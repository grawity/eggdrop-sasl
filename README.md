## Eggdrop 1.8 SASL script:

 0. For convenience, download this entire repository with `git clone https://github.com/grawity/eggdrop-sasl`

 1. Get Eggdrop 1.8 [from Git][egggit]. Compile and install.

    The `preinit-server` patch was [merged into Eggdrop 1.8][commit] recently, so you do not need to patch it manually anymore.

 2. From your Eggdrop config, `source` the scripts and set the SASL information.

    ```tcl
    source "scripts/eggdrop-sasl/g_base64.tcl"
    source "scripts/eggdrop-sasl/g_cap.tcl"

    set sasl-user "NoobBot"
    set sasl-pass "blahblah"
    ```

(For those who still need it, the [patch for 1.6.x][patch] is still there.)

### SCRAM-SHA support

 3. To enable support for SCRAM-SHA-1 or SCRAM-SHA-256, first ensure _tcllib_ is installed, then load two additional scripts:

    ```tcl
    source "scripts/eggdrop-sasl/g_pbkdf2.tcl"
    source "scripts/eggdrop-sasl/g_scram.tcl"

    set sasl-mechanism "SCRAM-SHA-256"
    ```

 4. Connect to the server. Note that the first connection attempt will need to
    generate the authentication token using PBKDFv2, which is *very slow* in
    Tcl so the server may time out. Just wait for Eggdrop to retry, and the
    second attempt should work fine.

 5. To improve security and to avoid the initial connection delay, you should
    remove the plaintext password from your _eggdrop.conf_ and replace it with
    the generated token.

    You can find this token in your Eggdrop logs, or by running `.tcl set
    sasl-pass` on the console after a successful connection. The token will
    look like this:

    ```tcl
    set sasl-pass "scram:a=sha256,s=<etc>,i=<etc>,H=<etc>"
    ```

    Note: The script will try to automatically add the token to your config,
    (although it won't remove the plaintext password â€“ you'll have to do that
    manually).

## Atheme auto-reop script:

 1. From your Eggdrop config, `source` the **g_atheme_need.tcl** script.

 2. Add a user named `services` to your bot, with ChanServ's hostmask, and give it the +fS flags.

        .+user services *!*@services.example.com
        .chattr services +fS

    Otherwise the bot can think it's being notice-flooded by ChanServ and ignore it.
